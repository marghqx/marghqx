## 🌿 About Me  

Hey there!👋 I'm Marta, a Computer Science student at <b>Warsaw University of Life Sciences</b> 🎓 with a curiosity that often leads me down random rabbit holes 🐇 — whether it's diving into code, breaking things, or just figuring out how stuff works. I'm looking for opportunities to gain practical experience and improve my software development skills . I enjoy tinkering with code, analyzing data, and exploring new programming languages to see what breaks (and hopefully, fix it!) 🔍. I'm always open to a challenge and eager to collaborate on innovative projects! 💡

If you have something interesting – don't hesitate to reach out! ✉️
